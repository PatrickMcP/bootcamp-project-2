# bootcamp-project-2
The Green Man Group

The purpose of the project is to bring the game of golf to the common person. We wanted to simplify a complex game. We bring the course to you. We have incorporated the layout of the course, a scoring system, and a personal tracking document to improve the enjoyment of the game.

Golf is traditionally looked at as an 'old mans' game. BY building this project we are trying to open it to a new generation. We put the location of the courses on your device. The application will show gps, distance, and average hole out. The user can track their score on individual holes, specific courses, and their scores for both will be kept for future reference. Currently we can track local courses. In the near, future we will have national and international courses available for a small fee.
